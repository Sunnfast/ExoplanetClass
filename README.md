# Exoplanet Class

An assignment for the introduction to C++ fundamentals class at City College of San Francisco.
The purpose of this assignment was to test understanding of classes and using mutator (set) and accessor functions (get).
I also used the private variable naming convention using an underscore to help build the habit when using classes going forward.
